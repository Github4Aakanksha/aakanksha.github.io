### *Sectoral PE Analysis and Trading Strategy with Machine Learning*
This project developed a trading strategy using machine learning based on sectoral price-to-earnings (PE) ratios from the health and industrial sectors. By normalizing data with Fisher transformations and fine-tuning buy/sell signals, the strategy was evaluated using metrics like the Sharpe ratio and annual returns. Combining the top-performing strategies from both sectors into an equally weighted portfolio showed the effectiveness of data-driven techniques for improving financial decision-making and trading performance.
